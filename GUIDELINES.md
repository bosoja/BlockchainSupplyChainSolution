# Blockchain-Based Supply Chain System Guidelines

Welcome to the Blockchain-Based Supply Chain System. This document provides an overview of best practices for interacting with our system, ensuring transparency, authenticity, and efficiency in the supply chain process.

## Getting Started

Before interacting with the system, ensure you have the following:
- A compatible Ethereum wallet.
- Some ETH for transaction fees.
- Access to our dApp interface or API.

## Product Registration

To register a product in the supply chain:
1. Navigate to the "Register Product" section in our dApp.
2. Fill in the product details, including name, description, and any relevant attributes.
3. Submit the registration transaction. A small fee in ETH is required.

## Product Tracking

Each product registered in our system is assigned a unique ID. Use this ID to:
- Check the product's current status.
- View its history across the supply chain.
- Verify authenticity and ownership.

## Updating Product Status

Authorized participants can update the status of a product (e.g., In Transit, Delivered). To do so:
1. Access the "Update Status" feature.
2. Enter the product's unique ID and the new status.
3. Submit the update transaction.

## Verifying Product Authenticity

Consumers and stakeholders can verify the authenticity of a product by:
1. Accessing the "Verify Product" tool.
2. Entering the product's unique ID.
3. Reviewing the product's detailed history and status.

## Best Practices

- Keep your wallet secure. Never share your private keys.
- Double-check product IDs when registering or updating products to avoid errors.
- Regularly review transaction fees and plan your actions accordingly to optimize costs.
